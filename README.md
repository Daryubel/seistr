This is the open-source Matlab package for 2D/3D local slope estimation and structural filtering

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first (and only) open-source Matlab package for calculating the seismic slope of an input seismic gather/cube/image and performing structure-oriented filtering.

Mathematical details can be found in the following reference:
